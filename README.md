*How to generate PDF file with Java programming by using Apache PDFBox*

In this code, I share my experience on how to generate pdf file with Netbeans. Actually, I got the tutorial from here : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pdfbox/pdfbox_tutorial.pdf.

However, there is a following error when I hit run button :
_Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory_
  
Luckily, you can find the solution by downloading "commons-logging-x.x.jar" and put it in your library, as explained in here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1551697/getting-java-lang-classnotfoundexception-org-apache-commons-logging-logfactory
  
So, here is my code. Happy coding :)
